# Term Manager

This is a JavaFX application that stores a list of terms in source and target language pairs.

For example:
Source: you
Target: あなた, 君

The terms are stored in XML.

You can search for source terms, and add new pairs, and update existing ones.

The GUI itself was largely adapted from "JavaFX 8 Tutorial" from
http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/
written by Marco Jakob.
All I did was tweaked the GUI, and added functionality to search for the source terms,
and to update existing terms.
