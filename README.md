# Term Manager

This is a JavaFX application that stores a list of terms in source and target language pairs.

For example:\n
Source: you\n
Target: あなた, 君\n

The terms are stored in XML.

You can search for source terms, and add new pairs, and update existing ones.

The GUI itself was largely adapted from "JavaFX 8 Tutorial" from
http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/
written by Marco Jakob.
All I did was tweaked the GUI, and added functionality to search for the source terms,
and to update existing terms.

To run, you need to have Java installed.
Then, with the Java runtime in your path, you can use the following command to run the jar.\n
java -jar TermManagerApp.jar\n
(use javaw instead of java if you don't want a console window)
